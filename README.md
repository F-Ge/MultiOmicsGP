# MultiOmicsGP
A Python tool for Functional Genomic Prediction. MultiOmicsGP integrates RNA-Seq and Genotype data, using transcriptomic variance to prioritize active genes and filter noise. Features include transcriptome-weighted GBLUP, biological feature selection, and ML models (Random Forest, SVR) to improve trait prediction accuracy in animals.
